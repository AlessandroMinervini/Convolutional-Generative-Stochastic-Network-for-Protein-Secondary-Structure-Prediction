# Convolutional Generative Stochastic Network for Protein Secondary Structure Prediction
An implementation for Deep Supervised and Convolutional Generative Stochastic Network for Protein Secondary Structure Prediction[1].
Convolutional Generative Stochastic Network is a particular variant of Generative Stochastic Network (Y.Bengio 2013)[2].

I will update the readme soon.
