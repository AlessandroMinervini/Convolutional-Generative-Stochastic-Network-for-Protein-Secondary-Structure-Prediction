# Convolutional Generative Stochastic Network for Protein Secondary Structure Prediction
An implementation for Deep Supervised and Convolutional Generative Stochastic Network for Protein Secondary Structure Prediction[1].
Convolutional Generative Stochastic Network is a particular variant of Generative Stochastic Network (Y.Bengio 2013)[2].

## Dataset
The model is evaluated on CullPDB_profile_6133[3] and CB513[4] and are avaiable here: http://www.princeton.edu/~jzthree/datasets/ICML2014/
